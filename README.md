Online Bookstore implemented by javaSwing

---This Application was implemented using offline XAMPP database.

• Using MySQL database management system, you can change the host, password, and uri from
  the ConnectionEstablisher Class in the database package.

• Users are allowed to signup for new accounts freely and added into the database directly,
  in addition   an admin account can be created to manage the store. So that books could be
  added or removed.

• There is no need to create tables in the database, they are automatically created if
  the connection is established and the writing permission to the database is granted.
